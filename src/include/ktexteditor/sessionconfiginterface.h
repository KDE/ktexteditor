 * \brief Session config interface extension for the Plugin and Plugin views.
 *
 * \ingroup kte_group_plugin_extensions
 *
 * \section sessionconfig_intro Introduction
 *
 * The SessionConfigInterface is an extension for Plugin%s and Plugin views
 * to add support for session-specific configuration settings.
 * readSessionConfig() is called whenever session-specific settings are to be
 * read from the given KConfigGroup and writeSessionConfig() whenever they are to
 * be written, for example when a session changed or was closed.
 *
 * \note A \e session does not have anything to do with an X-session under Unix.
 *       What is meant is rather a context, think of sessions in Kate or
 *       projects in KDevelop for example.
 *
 * \section sessionconfig_support Adding Session Support
 *
 * To add support for sessions, your Plugin has to inherit the SessionConfigInterface
 * and reimplement readSessionConfig() and writeSessionConfig().
 *
 * \section sessionconfig_access Accessing the SessionConfigInterface
 *
 * This section is for application developers such as Kate, KDevelop, etc that
 * what to support session configuration for plugins.
 *
 * The SessionConfigInterface is an extension interface for a Plugin or a
 * Plugin view, i.e. Plugin/Plugin view inherits the interface
 * \e provided that it implements the interface. Use qobject_cast to
 * access the interface:
 * \code
 * // object is of type Plugin* or, in case of a plugin view, QObject*
 * KTextEditor::SessionConfigInterface *iface =
 *     qobject_cast<KTextEditor::SessionConfigInterface*>( object );
 *
 * if( iface ) {
 *     // interface is supported
 *     // do stuff
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \see KTextEditor::Plugin
