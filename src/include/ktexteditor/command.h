/**
 * \brief An Editor command line command.
 *
 * \section cmd_intro Introduction
 *
 * The Command class represents a command for the editor command line. A
 * command simply consists of a string, for example \e find. The command
 * auto-registers itself at the Editor. The Editor itself queries
 * the command for a list of accepted strings/commands by calling cmds().
 * If the command gets invoked the function exec() is called, i.e. you have
 * to implement the \e reaction in exec(). Whenever the user needs help for
 * a command help() is called.
 *
 * \section cmd_information Command Information
 * To provide reasonable information about a specific command there are the
 * following accessor functions for a given command string:
 *  - name() returns a label
 *  - description() returns a descriptive text
 *  - category() returns a category into which the command fits.
 *
 * These getters allow KTextEditor implementations to plug commands into menus
 * and toolbars, so that a user can assign shortcuts.
 *
 * \section cmd_completion Command Completion
 *
 * The Command optionally can show a completion popup to help the user select
 * a valid entry as first parameter to the Command. To this end, return a
 * valid completion item by reiplementing completionObject().
 *
 * The returned completion object is deleted automatically once it is not needed
 * anymore. Therefore neither delete the completion object yourself nor return
 * the same completion object twice.
 *
 * \section cmd_interactive Interactive Commands
 *
 * In case the Command needs to interactively process the text of the parameters,
 * override wantsToProcessText() by returning @e true and reimplement processText().
 *
 * A typical example of an iterative command would be the incremental search.
 *
 * \see KTextEditor::CommandInterface
